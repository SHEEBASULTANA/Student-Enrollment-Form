# Student Enrollment Form with JsonPowerDB

## Description

This project is a **Student Enrollment Form** developed using **JsonPowerDB** for storing student information in the `SCHOOL-DB` database. The form allows users to add, update, and view student details such as Roll No., Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date.

The form is implemented using basic HTML, JavaScript, and **Talend API Tester** for making API calls to **JsonPowerDB**.

### Features:
- **Save**: Adds new student records to the database.
- **Update**: Modifies existing student records based on the Roll No.
- **Reset**: Clears all fields and resets the form to its initial state.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures that no fields are left empty during data entry.

## Benefits of Using JsonPowerDB

- **Schema-Free**: JsonPowerDB is a schema-free database, which means you don't need to define a schema upfront, making it easier to manage and work with JSON data.
- **Fast Data Retrieval**: It supports high-performance querying and data retrieval, making it ideal for real-time applications.
- **Serverless**: JsonPowerDB is a serverless database, which reduces the overhead of managing a server and makes it easier to scale.
- **Multi-Mode Database**: JsonPowerDB supports multiple data models like document-based, key-value, and relational models, making it highly flexible for various use cases.
